# FILE: 2_computational_bell_test.py
# DESC: Implements the computational "Bell Test" for 3-state systems on graphs,
#       as described in Section 3 of the paper. This experiment probes for a
#       direct violation of locality. The expected outcome, as per the paper,
#       is a "null result" where the inequality is respected.
